## Introduction

Welcome to Envless, a simple and powerful solution for managing environment variables in your application deployments.
Whether you are working on a small personal project or a large enterprise-level application, Envless can help simplify the deployment process
and ensure that your application runs smoothly.

At its core, Envless is a lightweight tool that manages environment variables for your applications.
It does this by intercepting environment variable reads and writes, and using a configuration file to override the values with those you specify.
This means that you can easily manage and modify environment variables without having to modify the codebase or the deployment environment.
This feature also enhances the security of your application by preventing the exposure of sensitive data, as it ensures that application
secrets are not stored on local machines. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure and only accessible to authorized parties,
thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

## Compatibility
One of the key features of Envless is its ability to integrate with different frameworks and deployment platforms.
It works with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Ruby, and Node.js, and can be used with popular frameworks like Flask, Django,
and Ruby on Rails. Additionally, Envless can be used with various deployment platforms, including Heroku, Kubernetes, and Docker.
