This CLI command will securely inject ENV variables for your project.

Example:-

{/* TODO - please add other languages and frameworks */}

|:---|:---|:---|
| node | `npm start` | `envless -r npm start` |
| laravel | `php artisan serve` | `envless -r php artisan serve` |
| Ruby on Rails | `rails start` | `envless -r rails start` |
| Add others üôè | `please add` | `please add` |

{/* TODO - please improve these steps */}
